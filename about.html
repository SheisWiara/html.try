<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a nursing student who spends a lot of time learning how to take care of people… 
  and occasionally surviving exams, clinicals, and caffeine shortages. 
  Healthcare is my main focus, but I also believe in keeping life interesting (and my brain busy), 
  which is how I ended up falling down the rabbit hole of web development.</p>

<p>When I’m not studying nursing concepts, I’m learning how to build websites through Udemy. 
  What started as a “let me just try this” hobby quickly turned into me debugging code at 2 a.m. 
  and celebrating when a button finally works. I’m currently learning the basics of front-end 
  and back-end development, discovering that coding requires just as much patience as nursing—maybe more.</p>

<p>Balancing nursing and web development has taught me how to problem-solve, stay curious, 
  and laugh at my mistakes (especially when nothing works the first time). Whether it’s caring 
  for patients or fixing broken code, I enjoy learning, growing, and proving that you can be both 
  a future nurse and a future tech wizard—scrubs by day, coder by night</p>
